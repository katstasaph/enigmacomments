# enigmacomments
Source code, in Python, for the Enigma Comments ex-Twitter, now-Cohost bot, at [https://cohost.org/enigmacomments]([https://cohost.org/enigmacomments).

The bot, inspired by accounts like [DiscoComments](https://twitter.com/discocomments), [EnyaComments](https://twitter.com/enyacomments), [Commentism](https://commentism.tumblr.com/), etc., reposts hopefully-interesting comments that Internet denizens have posted about the group [Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_(German_band)), popular among hippies, yuppies, Pure Moods purchasers, and TikTok zoomers. These comments are sourced from social media, newsgroups, guestbooks, etc., and date from the 1990s to present.

All comments come from publicly accessible sources. They are anonymized; full names or other identifying information are removed except in a few special cases (e.g., "I'm the director of this video, so glad to see it on YouTube!").
